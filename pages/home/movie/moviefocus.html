<br><br>

<div style="float: left; padding-left: 10%; width: 350px">All I remember about this series was that it was really good, and that I never finished watching it because season 2 took too long to release.
    I bought it for $17 on amazon. I can't add it to my plex library yet because I am having trouble getting into my NAS on my new system.

    This movie is rated R for a reason. I'll try to put this in spoiler-free terms:
    If you're at the part where someone is trapped somewhere with somebody, there is a very explicit scene that you should be prepared for.
    <br>That's all I'll say.<br><br>
    It's a really interesting movie otherwise, and I love everything else about it.<br><br>
    Most of the movie centers around two henchmen for a notorious crime-boss, mafia style.
    It's about their weird daily exploits and adventures. Plus some other philosophical crap.<br><br>
    <a href="https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Pulp-Fiction-4K-Blu-ray/252780/">I got this one on Amazon as well for around $9.</a>
