    <p>How radioactive is Ooo?

        I mean it’s ONLY 1000 years post mushroom war<br>
        You would automatically point to Hiroshima and Nagasaki as evidence of quick recovery from minimal fallout made by bombs but
        what about all the nuclear power plants<br>
        200 Chernobyl’s all across the entire planet because humanity perished<br>
        Then 700 years later PB is still cleaning up radioactive water<br>
        from her new kingdom
