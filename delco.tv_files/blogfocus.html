<p>i cleaned out my computer yesterday. it has been sitting under my desk without
    the lid for maybe 7-8 months now, so it collected a lotta dust and debris.
    I actually found a bottle cap wedged between two RAM sticks. im surprised my computer
    never exploded.

<div style="float:left; width: 42%"><p>I originally took the lid off because my video card kept overheating
    from the abysmall airflow in my case. i dont wanna run it like that anymore, so i shoved an extra fan
    next to the gpu and turned an exhaust into an intake. im not rlly sure if its working  yet cause i
    just installed linux and all my stuff is busted
